Tivoli is a library for the processing of volumetric images. It was developed at the [Department of Image and Signal Processing](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal) of [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)

The code is not intended for active usage, it contains deprecated sintax and it dates back to 1995.
